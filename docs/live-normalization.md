# Incremental live normalization

AGENTVIZ retains normalization state for Claude Code, Copilot CLI, Codex rollout JSONL, and VS Code base-plus-patch JSONL. This replaces the worker-only mitigation in PR #131. The batch `parseSession` path remains an independent oracle for complete normalized events, turns, and metadata.

## Contracts

- JSON decoding consumes complete new records. Blank lines and CRLF are accepted. An unfinished trailing record is buffered; no warning is emitted until an invalid line is complete. Complete JSON records without a trailing newline remain accepted for the existing SSE/client contract.
- `createLiveSessionParser` creates a single-owner accumulator. Append calls consume that state; callers must not branch by appending independently to an old state handle.
- Published results are independent snapshots by default, preserving prior render state even when an early event changes. The worker opts out of this extra copy with `{ snapshot: false }`; `postMessage` performs the required structured clone instead.
- Initial loading visits the initial history once. Ordinary appends retain records, event indices, turns, model counts, usage totals, and indexed duration maxima. No full-history concatenation of record arrays or batch-parser invocation occurs on ordinary appends.
- Sparse numeric indices have a fixed 32-level address space. Sorted timeline/turn lookups use binary search. Metadata publication also depends on the number of distinct models/reasoning efforts, not just the appended record count.
- Reset or file truncation creates a fresh accumulator. The single-flight client discards pending pre-reset batches and their results. An empty normalized session is published as `null`, including VS Code removal of all requests.
- An incompatible format declaration invalidates the format-dependent state. Static non-JSONL formats continue using their existing import parsers; this is not incremental support for arbitrary JSON documents.

## Format-specific dependencies

| Format | Retained state and affected updates |
| --- | --- |
| Claude Code | Synthetic and real timestamps, timestamp-majority decision, absolute-time minima, original event durations, deduplicated usage maxima, first usage-bearing event, session identity, and tool/result indices. A later usage fragment updates the first matching assistant event. An ordinary append recalculates only the previous boundary duration and new events. |
| Copilot CLI | Completion records, tool/message dependency lists, task/subagent identity, reasoning-effort boundaries, explicit turns, and per-turn maxima/error/tool counts. Completion updates keep unchanged `eventIndices` membership in place. Shutdown usage/cost and session metadata use the latest applicable records. |
| Codex | Current model/turn context, lifecycle records, cumulative token totals, web-search association indices, sorted events, explicit/unbound turn membership, and active turn aggregates. Late lifecycle and context changes update relevant turns and formerly unbound events. |
| VS Code | An owned mutable patch tree, cached request offsets, response-part positions, and per-request error counts. Local tool-result/content patches remap the affected response part. Structural response edits recalculate the affected request's proportional timestamps and propagate minimum-spacing changes only until boundaries settle. |

Global changes are not incorrectly treated as constant work. A changed timestamp origin or Claude timestamp-majority decision can affect the entire timeline. An out-of-order event or a structural request edit can shift an entire suffix of public evidence indices. New reasoning-effort or lifecycle information can affect earlier events. These changes explicitly invalidate affected state rather than leaving stale timestamps, memberships, totals, or tool outputs. They may require history-sized work when history-sized output changes.

## Codex tool timing

Completed Codex tool calls use the original call and matching result timestamps,
paired by `call_id`, for their observed duration. Function calls, custom tools,
patch completion events, and associated web searches share this rule. Parallel
calls retain independent intervals. Updated results use the latest result in
timeline order, matching output pairing.

Live results update the affected call and indexed session/turn duration maxima,
including earlier turns, without revisiting unrelated history. Missing or invalid
timestamps, missing results, and a result preceding its call retain the existing
display-duration fallback; they do not provide a measured tool duration. An early
return from a background command measures that tool invocation only, not the
command's entire lifetime across subsequent polling calls.

## Deterministic work and measurements

`normalizationWork` reports records/requests examined, event visits or updates, and turn membership/aggregate updates for the last append. Counts include affected old records, not just newly decoded lines. A VS Code patch plus its normalized request counts as two record/request operations. Counts are instrumentation, not CPU instruction counts. Separate regressions intercept turn-array `splice` to ensure completion updates do not hide history-sized index shifts.

Run the existing Vitest runner:

```powershell
npm test -- src\__tests__\liveNormalizationBenchmark.test.ts
```

The benchmark calls the retained normalizer directly, excluding JSON decoding and publication. It takes medians of 11 equal ten-record batches after 100 and 10,000 historical items. Copilot CLI and Codex retain a single large active turn; VS Code uses independent requests with a user message and response. Timing is observational, not a flaky test threshold. Equal deterministic work is asserted.

Representative Windows results:

| Format | Record/event/turn operations, both histories | Normalization ms, 100 / 10,000 | Snapshot clone ms, 100 / 10,000 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | 10 / 22 / 11 | 0.052 / 0.076 | 0.518 / 40.226 |
| Copilot CLI | 10 / 10 / 10 | 0.092 / 0.147 | 0.385 / 27.763 |
| Codex | 10 / 20 / 12 | 0.105 / 0.178 | 0.483 / 32.735 |
| VS Code | 20 / 30 / 10 | 0.073 / 0.230 | 0.802 / 68.288 |

Snapshot cloning is deliberately measured separately. It is not constant-time, nor is full worker serialization, raw-text transfer, downstream rendering, or derived UI computation. The browser worker test additionally checks actual worker/client delivery and timer progress; main-thread append timings in the existing cleanup benchmark include snapshot copying.

## Regression coverage

- Batch/live parity at every completed fixture prefix, including the multi-agent fixture.
- One-record, three-record, whole-batch, and seeded random byte partitions; blank/CRLF records and unfinished tails.
- Seeded out-of-order records, changed origins, timestamp-majority transitions, late/repeated tool results, cumulative usage, model/effort changes, shutdown, and resume.
- Late Codex lifecycle activation/deactivation and Copilot completion membership regressions found during self-review.
- Bound checks after 100/5,000 historical records, including one VS Code tool-result patch in a request containing 5,000 sibling responses.
- Real HTTP snapshot/SSE append and truncation-reset tests for every live format, plus cursor resume and partial UTF-8 regressions.
- Actual browser worker append parity and queued-reset discard for every live format, alongside the existing v2 and cleanup browser suites.
